## Summary
Visualization plays a critically important role in modern scientific research project. It is a very powerful tool to express results from observation and experiments, and visually provides scientists with an intuitive overview of the results. So any research project would not go without visualization, like plotting graph and it is often the case that scientists plots data in many different ways with many different axes to extract some meaningful phenomena. Although a simple graph can only express data with two axes, thanks to the development of computer graphics techniques, scientists can also easily visualize data on 3D space by using visualization software. However, as long as plotted on a flat display, data are reduced onto two dimensional and scientists could miss some information inherent in the data, especially in the field targeting at objects with complex geometries or a large number of entities, like material science.
